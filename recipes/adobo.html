        <h2>What is Pork Adobo?</h2>
        <p>The word Adobo was derived from the Spanish word “adobar”. It means to marinate. This can be in the form of a liquid marinade or to rub using a combination of powdered ingredient.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork</li>
            <li>Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>Vinegar</li>
            <li>Black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Cook onion, garlic, chile, if using, peppercorns, salt, and bay leaves, stirring occasionally, until garlic is lightly golden, 4 to 6 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain pork; reserve marinade. Increase heat to high and add pork to pot. Cook, stirring occasionally, until pan is dry and pork is lightly caramelized, 17 to 19 minutes.
